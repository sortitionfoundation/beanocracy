# Beanocracy

Scripts to create artifacts for games about sortition.

## How to run the script

First [install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) and [wkhtmltopdf](https://github.com/JazzCore/python-pdfkit/wiki/Installing-wkhtmltopdf).

Then you can just run:

```
./generate_profiles.py
```

This will create a directory called `html/` containing a set of HTML files - each will have 3 personas in it.
